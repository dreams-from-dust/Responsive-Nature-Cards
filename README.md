# Responsive Nature Cards

A clean, responsive web page featuring a collection of nature-themed cards. This project was built entirely with HTML and CSS, without the use of any frameworks, to demonstrate a foundational understanding of modern front-end development principles.

### Key Features
* **Responsive Design:** The card layout automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes, from large desktops to mobile phones. The design is built using a flexible grid with `flexbox` and a media query for mobile-first responsiveness.
* **Semantic HTML:** The project uses modern HTML5 tags to ensure a well-structured and accessible document.
* **Modular CSS:** The stylesheet is well-organized and uses a CSS reset for consistent styling across browsers.
* **Flexbox Techniques:** Advanced Flexbox properties like `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `margin-top: auto` were used to ensure the content and buttons are always aligned correctly, regardless of the card's content length.
